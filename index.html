  <h2>The Mission</h2>
  <p>
    Smart Grocery Saver exists to tackle the global crisis of food waste—one receipt at a time. With billions of tonnes of edible food discarded annually, we aim to transform household habits through simple yet powerful digital tools. Our app empowers users to scan receipts, track expiration dates, discover timely recipes, and understand their impact on the planet. By making waste reduction effortless and rewarding, we turn daily routines into climate-conscious actions.
  </p>

  <h2>The Vision</h2>
  <p>
We envision a world where technology actively supports sustainable living, and where no food goes to waste needlessly. Smart Grocery Saver aspires to be a catalyst for change—reducing waste, saving money, and inspiring responsible consumption. By helping users monitor what’s in their kitchens and plan smarter meals, we aim to build a community that values every bite. Our long-term goal is to create homes, cities, and systems where sustainability is second nature.
